             <p>Close by the Sun is Mercury, a practically atmosphere-like world that has a lot of craters. 
                 Until NASA's MESSENGER spacecraft arrived there in 2008, we knew very little about the planet—only part of it had been imaged!
                  But now that the spacecraft has been circling the planet for a few years, we know a heck of a lot more. 
                 Here is some stuff about Mercury that's useful to know.Close by the Sun is Mercury, a practically atmosphere-like world that has a lot of craters.

                The life cycle of a star spans billions of years. As a general rule, the more massive the star, the shorter its life span.
                Birth takes place inside hydrogen-based dust clouds called nebulae. Over the course of thousands of years, gravity causes pockets of dense matter inside the
                nebula to collapse under their own weight. One of these contracting masses of gas, known as a protostar, represents a star’s nascent phase. 
                ause the dust in the nebulae obscures them, protostars can be difficult for astronomers to detect.As a protostar gets smaller, it spins faster because of the conservation of angular 
                momentum—the same principle that causes a spinning ice skater to accelerate when she pulls in her arms. Increasing pressure creates rising temperatures, and during this time, a star enters
                what is known as the relatively brief T Tauri phase.
